# Wi-Fi-Controlled-LED-Illumination-System-Based-on-C8051F020-Single-Chip
Source code for the project. Done in Zhejiang University as a course project.

Main circuit modules include ULN2003, 74HC21N, 12864LCD, DS18B20 and a wi-fi module. Self-made circuit board powering 3Ã—5W LED bulbs.

The core controller is a Silicon Labs C8051F020 single-chip. Combined with the wifi module it enables us to control the brightness of each light bulb, monitor the status of each lightbulb as well as the environmental temperature.

An Android app is also created which can connect to the wi-module and remotely control and monitor the whole system. For this part of source code please e-mail to jq2250@columbia.edu.
